# Python Basics – Assignment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a set of **Python foundational questions and exercises**. Each question focuses on understanding **core Python concepts** such as syntax, variables, functions, loops, error handling, and more.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment includes both **theoretical** and **practical** Python questions to test fundamental programming understanding.

### Theory Questions

1. What is indentation in Python, and why is it important?
2. Explain the difference between syntax errors and runtime errors.
3. How do you assign a value to a variable?
4. What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types?
5. What is a lambda function? When is it useful?

### Programming Questions

6. Generate the first n Fibonacci numbers and print their sum.
7. Create variables `name`, `age`, and `city`, assign your details, and print them in one sentence.
8. Swap the values of two variables.
9. Calculate the area of a rectangle using variables `length` and `width`.
10. Convert a string "50" into an integer and add 100 to it.
11. Create a tuple of 3 elements and try to modify one — observe and explain the error.
12. Check if two lists have at least one element in common using sets.
13. Create a function `is_prime(n)` that checks whether a number is prime.
14. Create a function `is_palindrome(word)` that returns True if the word is a palindrome.
15. Create a simple calculator using functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).
16. Create a function `check_even_odd(num)` that prints whether a number is even or odd.
17. Create a function `reverse_number(n)` that returns the reverse of a number.
18. Write a program using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` together to demonstrate error handling.
